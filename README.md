├── app/            # Next.js page routes
├── lib/            # Utilities and helpers
├── goovee/         # Goovee ORM setup and models

```

Check the `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

Some important commands:

- Install the dependencies : `pnpm i`
- Generate ORM client : `pnpm generate`
- Build the project : `pnpm build`
- Start the app : `pnpm start`
- Run development server : `pnpm dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ORM

The application make use of `@goovee/orm` for data access.
Make sure to set the database url in `.env` file under the `DATABASE_URL` property :

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db-name>
```

Then, you can define models inside the goovee/schema folder. After each change in the schema folder, you need to re-run the generation command `pnpm generate` to propagate the changes inside the ORM client.
